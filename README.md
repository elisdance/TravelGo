[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com). You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure below.

```bash 
$ node --version
v0.10.24

$ npm --version
1.3.21

```

#### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app.

Please install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if it's not already done with the following command.

```bash 
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```
If everything when fine, you should run
```bash
brew install node
```
#### Node installation on Linux
``` bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
#### Node installation on Windows
Go on official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) & grab the installer. Also, be sure to have git available in your PATH, npm might need it.

### Gulp 
- Check for node, npm, and npx
``` bash
node --version
npm --version
npx --version
```
If they are not installed, follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

``` bash
npm install gulp -g
```

### Project Dependencies
